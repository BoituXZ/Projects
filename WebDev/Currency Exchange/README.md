# Javascript Familiarisation.

Since I have started to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JS, I need a project to let everything stick. In this project I wish to make an app that can convert one currency to another using real time date.
## Outline
### API
I believe I will need to get an API to fetch up to date data on each currency - as of the date of creation (22 July 2024) I do not know how to use APIs.
### UI/UX
I will use the basic HTML, CSS and JS for this. I have seen glimpses of React. It seems interesting I will Look to implement it in that as  I learn.
### I believe that's all for now.
